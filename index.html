              <b><u>Kutub Minar: </u></b> The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub
              Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms
              part of the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi’s oldest
              fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs. It is a
              UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi,
              India. It is one of the most visited tourist spots in the city,
              mostly built between 1199 and 1220.It can be compared to the
              62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190,
              which was constructed a decade or so before the probable start of
              the Delhi tower.

              <b><u>Lotus Temple: </u></b> The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi,
              India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December
              1986. Notable for its lotus like shape, it has become a prominent
              attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the
              Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other
              qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing
              marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine
              sides, with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height
              of slightly over 34 meters and a capacity of 1,300 people. The
              Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been
              featured in many newspaper and magazine articles<a

              <b><u>Taj Mahal: </u></b> The Taj Mahal. 'Crown of the Palace' is
              an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the
              river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in
              1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the
              tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb
              of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
              (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and
              is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated
              wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in
              1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for
              another 10 years.

              <b><u>Gateway of India: </u></b
              >The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th
              century in the city of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to
              commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first
              British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road
              near Wellington Fountain. The foundation stone was laid in March
              1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by
              elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design
              of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in
              1914, and construction was completed in 1924.

              <b><u>Red Fort: </u></b
              >The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic
              fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that
              historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors.
              Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12
              May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.
              Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect
              Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort
              represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and
              combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
              The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader
              Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739.
