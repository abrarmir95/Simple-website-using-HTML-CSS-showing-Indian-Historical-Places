              <b><u>Kutub Minar:</u></b> The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub
              Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms
              part of the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi’s oldest
              fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs. It is a
              UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi,
              India. It is one of the most visited tourist spots in the city,
              mostly built between 1199 and 1220.It can be compared to the
              62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190,
              which was constructed a decade or so before the probable start of
              the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated
              with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a
              shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the
              balconies" at the top of each stage. In general, minarets were
              slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main
              mosque where they exist.

              <b><u>Lotus Temple:</u></b> The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi,
              India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December
              1986. Notable for its lotus like shape, it has become a prominent
              attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the
              Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other
              qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing
              marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine
              sides, with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height
              of slightly over 34 meters[ and a capacity of 1,300 people. The
              Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been
              featured in many newspaper and magazine articles

              <b><u>Taj Mahal:</u></b> The Taj Mahal. 'Crown of the Palace') is
              an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the
              river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in
              1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the
              tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb
              of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
              (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and
              is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated
              wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in
              1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for
              another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
              completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time
              to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70
              billion (about US $1 billion).
